# Suggested Improvements for tabu-db-api

Based on the code analysis, here are several improvement recommendations for the tabu-db-api project:

## 1. Code Quality and Structure

- **[DONE] Fix Schema Variable Typo**: There appears to be a typo in the schema variable name (`shemaName` instead of `schemaName`) across model files. This should be corrected for consistency.
    
- **Centralize Configuration**: Create a dedicated config module to handle environment variables instead of reading them directly in different files. This would prevent duplication and ensure consistency.
    
- **Error Handling**: Implement a consistent error handling strategy with custom error classes rather than just logging and re-throwing errors.

## 2. Security Enhancements

- **Input Validation**: Add comprehensive input validation for all API endpoints using a library like Joi or express-validator.
    
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API endpoints.
    
- **Security Headers**: Add security headers middleware (like helmet.js) to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## 3. Performance Improvements

- **Connection Pooling**: Ensure BigQuery connections are properly managed, potentially implementing connection pooling for better resource utilization.
    
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database queries.
    
- **Pagination**: Add proper pagination for all listing endpoints to handle large datasets efficiently.

## 4. Developer Experience

- **API Documentation**: Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation to make the API easier to understand and consume.
    
- **Enhanced Logging**: Implement structured logging with different log levels and request IDs for better debugging.
    
- **Automated Tests**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests, particularly for data models and API routes.

## 5. Architecture Improvements

- **Service Layer**: Add a service layer between routes and models to encapsulate business logic and make the code more maintainable.
    
- **DTO Consistency**: Ensure all responses use consistent DTO patterns for better API predictability.
    
- **Middleware Organization**: Organize middleware into separate files based on functionality.

## 6. Deployment and DevOps

- **Containerization**: Ensure proper Docker setup with optimized images for production.
    
- **Environment Configuration**: Improve environment variable handling with validation and defaults.
    
- **Health Checks**: Add health check endpoints for monitoring and observability.

## 7. Specific Code Improvements

- **SQL Injection Prevention**: While parameterized queries are used, ensure all user input is properly sanitized before constructing any query strings.
    
- **Async/Await Consistency**: Ensure consistent use of async/await pattern throughout the codebase.
    
- **Transaction Support**: Implement transaction support for operations that modify multiple tables.
